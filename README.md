# Ahhhhtopous Killer
This is a mini game made with scratch.

- **Goal:** eliminate green octopuses by controlling the purple ship to shoot bullets.  
- **Control:**
  - To move the ship: Use the up/down/right/left keys  
  - To shoot bullets: Press the space key  
- **FYI:** The highlight of the game is the sound that the octopuses make while being shot. I find it amusing while recording my own voice :D
